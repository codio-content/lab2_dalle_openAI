## Pushing to GitHub

For the final step, you must push your work to GitHub. For that we need to move our main file into our Dall-E_lab folder's main file (cloned from GitHub).

In the terminal, after you are done copying the main file:
* Move into the Dall-E lab folder 
```bash
cd Dall-E_lab
```

* Commit your changes:

```bash 
git add .
git commit -m "Finished The Dall-E program"
```

* Push to GitHub:

```bash
git push
```
